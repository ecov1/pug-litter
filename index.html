    <h2>About the Puppies</h2>
    <p>Winston and Lulu were both pandemic puppies born in January 2020 in California. They moved to
      New York when they were 9 months old and soon after, they became parents for the first time!
      These puppies are their third and last litter. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/winLu.jpeg" alt="Winston and Lulu" class="about-photo">
      <br>
      <br>
      They were conceived on Valentine’s Day 2025 when Lulu hopped the big metal cage barrier in the stairwell to join her mate.
      2 puppies were born late on the evening of Good Friday and 5 puppies were born a few hours
      into Saturday. 
      <br>
      <br>
      There are 5 male and 2 female. I will be holding on to the little black male for 6
      months because it is too sad to see everyone leave - for the puppy parents and for us.

    <div class="gallery">
      <!-- Copy & paste this block for each puppy -->
      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/acrobat.png" alt="Puppy 1">
        <p>Acrobat can contort and stretch better than his litter mates. He is so cute! </p>
      </div>
      <!-- /puppy -->

      <!-- Example placeholder, add more as needed -->
      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/avocado.png" alt="Puppy 2">
        <p>Avocado is the little runt of the litter. She is delicate and agile. She has already propelled
          herself out of the box she shares with her siblings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/triangle.png" alt="Puppy 7">
        <p>Triangle is aptly named because she has a big white triangle across her chest. With time, this
          becomes less visible once the pugs grow lots of chest fur but it reminds me of the Avengers.
          Triangle is one of the biggest puppies in the litter.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/gordito.png" alt="Puppy 4">
        <p>Gordito is the largest puppy. Even his face is big! He is very strong and gets as much milk as he
          wants because no one is going to stop him!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/nori.png" alt="Puppy 5">
        <p>Nori is the one and only black pug in the litter. He enjoys crawling all over his litter mates for
          the most comfortable spot at the top of the puppy heap.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/texas.png" alt="Puppy 6">
        <p>Texas has a mark that reminds me of the state of Texas. He is very strong!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="puppy">
        <img src="images/coeur.png" alt="Puppy 3">
        <p>Cœur which means “heart” in French has a little white heart on his chest when viewed at the
          right angle. It is a bit lopsided but that makes it even more endearing.</p>
